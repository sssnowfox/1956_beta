 ######## LOYA JIRGA EVENTS ########

 AFG_loya_jirga.1.t:0 "The [GetYear] Loya Jirga Begins"
 AFG_loya_jirga.1.desc:0 "For centuries, the Pashtun social code has shaped the cultural and social norms of both the common folk and the elite. According to this tradition, the nation's leaders, together with tribal chiefs, hold an annual Loya Jirga to chart the country's course in times of uncertainty. \n\nThis year's Jirga will focus on critical issues, including the social status of women, the industrialization of Kābul, recently introduced educational reforms, and the nation's foreign policy. The King, alongside his cabinet, is expected to arrive shortly. However, tensions are rising as reports indicate discontent among farmers in Nimruz and Farah over supply distribution, and northerners from Takhar are concerned about recent Basmachi raids in their region. Additionally, factions within the army are expected to express dissatisfaction with the ongoing military modernization efforts.In contrast, Kābul is expected to show strong support, especially following the recent opening of the country's first university. \n\nThe King has been advised to take a firm stance on military issues but to remain open to concessions if the debate becomes too contentious. We must avoid repeating the mistakes of the 1928 Loya Jirga and carefully balance the passions of both modernizers and traditionalists as we move forward."
 AFG_loya_jirga.1.a:0 "We will make sure not to miss it."

 AFG_loya_jirga.2.t:0 "The Path to Modernization - Question of State"
 AFG_loya_jirga.2.desc:0 "[AFG.GetNonIdeologyName] remains a highly decentralized state, with the government exerting little authority beyond the capital, Kābul. This has resulted in an inefficient economy, weak administration, and an underdeveloped military. \n\nThe modernizers advocate for expanding Kābul's direct control over the country and centralizing state power, which would streamline governance, reduce bureaucratic inefficiencies, and improve cost-effectiveness. \n\nHowever, this shift would significantly affect the lives of Afghans outside Kābul, who are unaccustomed to such levels of government oversight. As a result, this proposal is likely to face resistance from the traditionalists..."
 AFG_loya_jirga.2.a:0 "[AFG.GetNonIdeologyName] must pursue a path of moderate centralization."
 AFG_loya_jirga.2.b:0 "Ensuring strong, unified governance throughout the nation is crucial!"

 AFG_loya_jirga.3.t:0 "The Path to Modernization - Status of Women"
 AFG_loya_jirga.3.desc:0 "As [AFG.GetNonIdeologyName] navigates the complexities of modernization, the question of women's rights has emerged as a pressing issue during this year's Loya Jirga. The stark divide between traditionalists, who advocate for the preservation of cultural norms, and modernizers, who seek to advance women's rights and opportunities, has sparked heated discussions. \n\nOn one side, traditionalists argue that the Pashtun social code should continue to guide women's roles, emphasizing the importance of family and cultural values. They fear that expanding rights could undermine societal stability and lead to the erosion of customs that have defined Afghan life for generations. \n\nConversely, modernizers advocate for significant reforms, proposing measures such as increased access to education, legal rights, and participation in public life. They argue that empowering women is essential for the nation's progress and will contribute to a more prosperous and equitable society."
 AFG_loya_jirga.3.a:0 "We must uphold the status quo..."
 AFG_loya_jirga.3.b:0 "Empowring women is crucial for [AFG.GetNonIdeologyName]'s future!"

 AFG_loya_jirga.4.t:0 "The Path to Modernization - Question of Islam"
 AFG_loya_jirga.4.desc:0 "Many key modernizers have, for quite some time, argued and debated over whether Islam is still compatible with the goals for [AFG.GetNonIdeologyName]'s future. This pivotal debate has finally come to a boiling point, and it is time for us to take a stance and decide whether Islam should, or shouldn't be separated from the state. \n\nProponents of Islam argue that the country's identity is intrinsically tied to its religious values and that governance should reflect the teachings of the Qur'an. They contend that an Islamic framework is essential for maintaining social cohesion and moral integrity, ensuring that laws align with the beliefs of the majority. For them, secularism represents a departure from tradition and a potential threat to the fabric of Afghan society. \n\nOn the other hand, advocates for secularism argue that a separation of religion and state is vital for fostering progress and ensuring equal rights for all citizens, regardless of their faith. They point to the benefits of secular governance, such as enhanced freedom of expression, the protection of minority rights, and the promotion of gender equality. This faction believes that embracing secularism will allow [AFG.GetNonIdeologyName] to modernize and compete on the global stage while respecting individual liberties."
 AFG_loya_jirga.4.a:0 "We must reaffirm our commitment to Islamic principles."
 AFG_loya_jirga.4.b:0 "Separation of religion and state is essential!"

 AFG_loya_jirga.5.t:0 "The Path to Modernization - Social Reforms"
 AFG_loya_jirga.5.desc:0 "The issue of widespread illiteracy has finally come to the forefront of this year's Loya Jirga. Delegates are divided on how best to address this critical problem, with some advocating for a comprehensive literacy program while others caution against provoking the traditionalists with rapid changes. \n\nProponents of a large-scale literacy program argue that immediate action is necessary to uplift the nation and ensure its future prosperity. They contend that investing in education is essential for developing a skilled workforce, enhancing political participation, and fostering economic growth. This ambitious approach envisions a robust initiative to educate the masses, particularly women, who have been historically marginalized in educational opportunities. \n\nConversely, cautious voices advocate for a more gradual approach, emphasizing the need to respect cultural sensitivities and the traditional way of life. They warn that a sudden push for widespread education could lead to backlash from traditionalist factions, who may see it as an encroachment on their customs and values. This faction suggests implementing localized programs that build on existing community structures, allowing for a smoother transition toward increased literacy without alienating those wary of change."
 AFG_loya_jirga.5.a:0 "Gradual illiteracy elemination is critical."
 AFG_loya_jirga.5.b:0 "Nonesense, education is the upholder of stability!"

 AFG_loya_jirga.6.t:0 "The End of the [GetYear] Loya Jirga"
 AFG_loya_jirga.6.desc:0 "With all the tribal leaders and speakers having made their voices heard, the [GetYear] Loya Jirga has come to a close.[GetLoyaJirgaEventDesc]. It is now our responsibility to act on the proposals and wishes put forward by the members of the Jirga. While we have some time to implement these changes, delaying too long could provoke the ire of the tribal leaders."
 AFG_loya_jirga.6.a:0 "Great."

 AFG_loya_jirga_good:0 "During the Jirga, the King and his government adopted a conciliatory and friendly approach toward its members, expressing a strong desire for cooperation, and the upholding of the status quo. The Kābul Times characterized this year's Jirga as both democratic and transparent"
 AFG_loya_jirga_bad:0 "During the Jirga, the King and his government adopted an aggressive and unfriendly stance toward reforms and the members of the assembly, seeking immediate and radical reform. This approach faced significant resistance from the delegates and drew sharp criticism from the Kābul Times and numerous other news agencies"

 AFG_loya_jirga.10.t:0 "The Course of the 1936 Loya Jirga"
 AFG_loya_jirga.10.d:0 "As the Loya Jirga is about to begin, we have a brief window to shape the political direction of this year's assembly. The Regency, led by Prime Minister Muhammad Hashim Khan and War Minister Shah Mahmud Khan, has urged the King to continue pursuing gradual centralization and modernization, seeking a delicate balance between the demands of modernizers and the concerns of traditionalists. In the past, any attempts at rapid reform have been met with strong resistance from the tribal populations, who oppose changes they view as a threat to Pashtunwali, their ancestral code of living. \n\nThese simple folk desire stability and respect for their cultural customs. Offering concessions and seeking compromises with the traditionalists, in terms of local autonomy and ratifying the Hasht Nafari, may encourage them to cooperate with the government, ensuring a more peaceful and unified [AFG.GetNonIdeologyName]."
 AFG_loya_jirga.10.a:0 "[AFG.GetNonIdeologyName] has no time to waste, reforms must be enacted swiftly!"
 AFG_loya_jirga.10.b:0 "We must implement reforms, gradually, as not to anger the traditionalists..."

 ######## OTHER EVENTS ########

 afghanistan.1.t:0 "Tribal Chiefs Offer Assistance"
 afghanistan.1.d:0 "During our time of need, a local tribe in has approached us with an offer of military service. The tribe, known for their fierce fighting skills and loyalty, is willing to provide soldiers to bolster our army's ranks.\n\nHowever, this offer comes with potential consequences. The tribe will expect preferential treatment and may demand a larger role in our military operations. If granted, this could lead to our army becoming more reliant on these tribes, potentially causing tension with other factions within the country."
 afghanistan.1.a:0 "We could use all the help we can get."
 afghanistan.1.b:0 "We do not require such assistance."

 afghanistan.2.t:0 "[AFG.GetNonIdeologyName] Requests Political Support"
 afghanistan.2.d:0 "[AFG.GetNonIdeologyName] lacks political leaders and revolutionaries to lead the people and the Hezb-e Khalq, we should send Tajik advisors to [AFG.GetNonIdeologyName] as they are culturally and linguistically similar to the local people, if we choose not to send any diplomatic and political support [AFG.GetNonIdeologyName] might distance itself from us and follow another path separate of [SOV.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]!"

 afghanistan.3.t:0 "The Tajikistan Issue"
 afghanistan.3.d:0 "The [AFG.GetAdjective] government has approached us with a interesting request, they have requested the transfer of ownership of [742.GetName] to Afghanistan. This does not come without any reasoing however, the Tajik and Pashtun people have lived in relative peace throughout the centuries in [AFG.GetNonIdeologyName] and have much in common. It would be wise to grant them this concession as they would most likely face less political resistance from the Tajiks."
 afghanistan.3.a:0 "We shall reward [AFG.GetNonIdeologyName]'s loyalty..."
 afghanistan.3.b:0 "Ridiculous! Tajikistan is an integral part of [ROOT.GetNameDef]!"

 afghanistan.4.d:0 "After receiving the letter some days ago, [SOV.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] has agreed to what we have proposed, [742.GetName] shall be incorporated into [AFG.GetNonIdeologyName]. We must hope that the Tajiks do not resist the new change in government and local rule. However, we shall have to carefully balance between the Tajik communities and the rest of [AFG.GetNonIdeologyName] in the future, as [AFG.GetNonIdeologyName] is now a nation of all Tajiks as well..."
 afghanistan.4.a:0 "Tajiks and Pashtuns, once more in harmony!"

 afghanistan.5.t:0 "[AFG.GetNonIdeologyName] Proposes Invasion of [PER.GetNonIdeologyName]"
 afghanistan.5.d:0 "We have received an interesting proposal by the [AFG.GetAdjective] government, they propose a joint invasion of [PER.GetNameDef] in order to secure the southern front and prevent any unwanted influence from infiltrating Persia. This would help us further our interests in the Middle East also and would secure more oil fields as well as protecting our own in Baku."

 afghanistan.5.b:0 "This does not concern us currently..."

 afghanistan.6.t:0 "[SOV.GetAdjective]s Reject Our Proposal"
 afghanistan.6.d:0 "After receiving the letter some days ago, [SOV.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] has decided to reject our request.

Although a big part of the [AFG.GetAdjective] population is ethnically Tajik, [AFG.GetNonIdeologyName] will never be able to unite the Tajik lands!"
 afghanistan.6.a:0 "Poor choice, Mr. [SOV.GetLeader]!"

 afghanistan.7.t:0 "Nomads Resettle in [AFG_nomad_state.GetName]"
 afghanistan.7.d:0 "Many nomads from neighboring deserts and valleys have decided to settle in [AFG_nomad_state.GetName], as reported by the Wilayat Governors in [AFG_nomad_state.GetName]. This will of course benefit our economy, however we must hope that [AFG_nomad_state.GetName] can support such a large influx of nomads in such a short period of time."

This time, he has planned to go on the same tour as he did in 1928, visiting Cairo, Rome, Paris, [ENG.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], [GER.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], Warsaw and finally Istanbul.

After recieving the news, [SOV.GetLeader] called for an assembly of his most loyal men, they then carefully and considerately debated over the proposal that was presented. After many long hours of heated debate, due to significant disagreements among the bolsheviks, a decision was not reached. It seems that [SOV.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] does not have an interest in [AFG.GetNonIdeologyName], we may only hope that this does not mean the end for [SOV.GetAdjective]-[AFG.GetAdjective] relations."

 afghanistan.21.d:0 "Earlier today, a raid was conducted on Qiamuddin's house by the KhAD, he was arrested for a suspected plot against the government and party of Afghanistan, the head of the KhAD has proposed three solutions to his arrest, executing him will anger the Parcham faction but would also remove one of its more, if not the most influential leaders, simply arresting him and removing him from [AFG.GetAdjective] politics is also a good choice, we could also release him but this would cause instability and would strengthen the Parcham."
 afghanistan.21.a:0 "I say, send him to the gallows!"
 afghanistan.21.b:0 "Arrest the traitor, he shall be sentenced to life imprisonment."

 afghanistan.24.d:0 "Over the lush Wakhan Corridor, a war in distant land has broken out. Just today at dawn, around forty men rode into Kābul on horseback, it seems as if they had come from the east, from the now war-torn region of Tunganistan. Exhausted from many days of riding but still with much to convey, they immediately requested to speak to [AFG.GetLeader]. After identifying who these men truly were, their request was granted. \n\nThe leader of this expedition was none other than Muhammad Amin Bughra, the exiled leader of the East Turkestan Republic. He and some of his followers had travelled hundreds of miles to deliver the news of the Kashgar Rebellion to Kābul. Along with that, they had also requested military support for Tunganistan. \n\nAfter hearing this, many generals and senior officers of the [AFG.GetAdjective] Army advised [AFG.GetLeader] to indulge the expeditioners, our support could mean a lot to them as it is the only one they have."
 afghanistan.24.a:0 "Our full support is yours!"

 afghanistan.26.t:0 "The Disappearence of the Pamir Flight"
 afghanistan.26.d:0 "Three weeks have gone by, there has been no reports of the Pamir Flight. By our estimates, they should already have been here four days ago, but they aren't. However, there is still hope, as our estimates might not be correct after all and they might return at any moment, maybe right this second they are landing in Kābul.We shall pray for their safe return."

 afghanistan.29.d:0 "Following the recent coup in [AFG.GetNameDefCap], and the ultimate demise of the Kingdom of [AFG.GetNonIdeologyName], King Zahir Shah and the Royal Family of [AFG.GetNonIdeologyName] have been deposed.

 afghanistan.30.d:0 "After Faqir was contacted in the recent struggle against the King, the fact that the King had taken a fully figurehead approach, Muhammad Hashim Khan, the prime minister is an obviously liberal governing figure, as the Jamiat was approached and Maududi, a well-known Islamist political activist has agreed to issue a fatwa against Hashim Khan declaring him a 'Taghut' or a 'Tyrant' a person which open rebellion is justified against"

 afghanistan.35.d:0 "The Shura, or 'Council' in Pashto, represents an early Islamic principle which promotes the establishment of an advisory board between the leader and certain advisors the King or Emir would hold near. During the early stages of Islam, caliphates, such as the Rashidun, set up councils of advisors who would, in times of need, seek to aid the leader on matters of the state.\n\nHowever, for centuries, the dilemma of who exactly should be able to appoint these advisors has never been answered fully. Some think that only the high and mighty elites of the country should be able to have a sway in the leader's choices, others think that the leader himself should be granted the right to elect his own council, while a more modern approach has been gaining popularity, that being democracy, with men over twenty five being eligible to vote in councillors."
