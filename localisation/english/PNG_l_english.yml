 r56.news_event.1121.desc:0 "'Rabaul volcano is one of the most active and most dangerous volcanoes in Papua New Guinea' a famous quote by many volcanologists has now been proven true, as both the Vulcan and Tavurvur erupted simultaneously, killing 507 people, and destroying the entire city of Rabaul. the skies were filled with the smoke of the volcano, blocking the sky for hours on and, and Rabaul was left in ruins. the Mandate Government has been moved to the more secure port city of Lae, which is far from any volcanically active volcano. so far there have been no reports on what the next steps the Australian Government is willing to take, but it seems likely that Rabaul will almost never recover from this giant and catastrophic event."
