While the Dashnaks emphasize Armenian nationalism and independence, the Hunchaks prioritize socialist ideals, cooperation with the Soviets and often favor alliances that serve broader revolutionary goals. This split has sown discord within Armenian politics, with both parties fiercely protective of their distinct visions for Armenia's future. Now, as the nation faces new threats and opportunities, internal rivalries threaten to hinder unity when it is most needed, leaving Armenia divided and vulnerable to external influence."
